            <h2>Flexibility exercises</h2>
            <p>Moving your joints through their full range of motion helps you keep your muscles working well. Stretches
                are best performed after your muscles are warmed up â€” at the end of your exercise session, for example,
                or after a 10-minute warm-up. They should be done gently and slowly, without bouncing.</p>

            <h2>Stability and balance exercises</h2>
            <p>Fall prevention is especially important for people with osteoporosis. Stability and balance exercises
                help your muscles work together in a way that keeps you more stable and less likely to fall. Simple
                exercises such as standing on one leg or movement-based exercises such as tai chi can improve your
                stability and balance.</p>

            <h2>Weight-bearing aerobic activities</h2>
            <p>Weight-bearing aerobic activities involve doing aerobic exercise on your feet, with your bones supporting
                your weight. Examples include walking, dancing, low-impact aerobics, elliptical training machines, stair
                climbing and gardening.</p>
