    <h1>Diabetes Exercises</h1>

            <h2>Weight Training</h2>
            <p>Plan for resistance exercise or weight training at least twice a week as part of your diabetes management
                plan, recommends the HHS. Regardless of your experience, you can safely add resistance exercise into
                your routine, according to the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)..</p>

            <h2>Low-Impact Exercise</h2>
            <p>Swimming is another aerobic exercise — and an ideal one for people with type 2 diabetes because it
                doesn’t
                put pressure on your joints. “Being buoyed by the water is less stressful on your body compared to
                walking or jogging,” Colberg says</p>

            <h2>Stationary Bicycling</h2>
            <p>Bicycling is also a form of aerobic exercise, says the HHS, one that makes your heart stronger and your
                lungs function better, and is a calorie burner to boot. Just riding a few times per week as a casual
                mode of transportation was found to reduce the risk of obesity, high blood pressure, and triglyceride
                levels, according to a study published in March 2018 in the American Journal of Health Promotion.</p>
