            <h2>Walking</h2>
            <p>One of the most pleasant ways to get the body moving (and it doesn’t cost a thing!) Whether it’s around
                the house or outside for some sunshine and fresh air, any amount of time spent walking is going to
                benefit blood flow for a healthy body and mind. Incorporate it into daily routines like walking the dog
                or a walk to the grocery store..</p>

            <h2>Sitting and standing exercise</h2>
            <p>These help to exercise the muscles needed for essential activities like using the toilet. Sitting on a
                chair with toes back beneath the knees and simply standing up off the chair and sitting back down for a
                repetition of about 10 times consecutively every day is a great way to strengthen muscles. Depending on
                the level of mobility, aids like a walker or handrail may be needed, safety is number 1.</p>

            <h2>Chair stretches</h2>
            <p>Here is a great Head to Toe seated chair exercise for Seniors that focuses on maintaining and improving
                range of motion. Doing this exercise regularly can improve strength, flexibility, and blood circulation.
                This is also an effective way to reduce fall risk and can help reduce pain.</p>
